        "answer": "If your device is lost or stolen, you can suspend Apple Pay by using the 'Find my iPhone' app or going to www.icloud.com and choosing the option for 'Lost Mode.' You'll also be given the option to 'Erase All' on www.icloud.com. This will delete all cards from Apple Pay and the Secure Element.

      {
        "question": "What happens when my card is replaced?",
        "answer": "Whether your card is replaced because it is lost or stolen, or if the card has expired, in most cases your new card will be automatically associated to the existing Digital Account Number (Token) in your device, and continue to be used for payments in Apple Pay. If, for some reason, Chase could not re-add your new card to the existing Digital Account Number (Token), you'll see a notation in the Apple Pay App that the card isn't active for use. You can then re-add your card, as you did initially to make it active again."

      {
        "question": "How do I make returns with purchases I've made using Apple Pay?",
        "answer": "You can make a return the same way you would with your plastic card today by contacting the merchant directly. We do recommend you bring the device that you used when returning items purchased with Apple Pay."
