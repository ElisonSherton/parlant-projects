        "question": "What is required for a business credit card application?",
        "answer": "Business credit card applications vary, but you might be surprised by the short list of information you may need to provide. There are typically not a lot of requirements to apply for a business credit card.

        "question": "Do I need revenue to get a business credit card?",
        "answer": "No, you might not need business revenue. It may be possible to obtain a business credit card without proving any revenue derived from your business, but you will probably still need to show income. Absent business revenue, the card issuer likely will analyze your income and personal credit to make a business credit card determination. So, while you might not need to show that your business is making money, you may still need to demonstrate that you have income."

        "question": "Do business credit cards impact my personal credit score?",
        "answer": "Applying for a business credit card can impact your personal credit score. Most credit card issuers will run a hard inquiry when you apply. They might rely on your personal credit to help determine your creditworthiness. Hard inquiries may affect your credit score, but it's usually temporary. As a rule of thumb, you generally will need good to excellent personal credit to be approved."

        "answer": "To raise your credit limit, you'll need to request an increase from your card issuer. Depending on your issuer, you likely can make a request online or over the phone. When determining the credit limit for a business, the card issuer may take a few factors into account, including your business credit score, revenue, history of repayment, and current debt obligations.

Once submitted, you may get a decision immediately or it can take up to 30 days for an answer."

Also consider that for new business cardholders, there may be a compelling introductory offer, like 0% APR for a limited time or a welcome bonus if you meet certain spending criteria."
