        "question": "If I take advantage of an offer, will it affect future interest charges on my new purchases?",
        "answer": "Prior to taking advantage of any offer, if you did not have a balance or if you paid your balance in full each month, you did not pay interest on your new purchases. This is referred to as an interest-free period (also called a grace period). If you take this offer and do not pay off your entire balance each month (including the promotional balances that you add by using this offer), you will lose that interest-free period. This means that you will begin paying interest on all new purchases, even if you pay your purchase balance in full each month. New purchases include any fees added to your purchase balance, such as an annual fee, if applicable."

        "question": "Under what circumstances can you decline balance transfers I've requested?",
        "answer": "We may decline your transfer request under the following circumstances: your account is past due or over limit, you request more than the maximum amount disclosed, we reasonably believe that you will be unable or unwilling to repay the balance, or for any other reason as described in your Cardmember Agreement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are my payments allocated?",
        "answer": "Generally, we first apply an amount equal to your minimum payment to the balance on your monthly statement with the lowest APR, which may be the amount you add by transferring a balance. Any payment above your minimum payment would generally then be applied to the balance on your monthly statement with the highest APR first. Payments are applied to balances as they appear on your monthly statement before being applied to new transactions."

      {
        "question": "If I recently had my card replaced because it was lost or stolen, can I still request a balance transfer?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can still request a balance transfer by calling the number on the back of your card or by signing in above."
